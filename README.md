## 🧪 How It Works

1. **Input Phase**: User types a message.
2. **Toxicity Classification**: The system evaluates the input’s toxicity level (e.g., using a multi-label classifier).
3. **Rewriting Phase**: If toxic, the message is rewritten with polite alternatives while retaining meaning.
4. **Output Display**: Both the original and rephrased messages are displayed with toxicity score.
